```Let me break it down for you, Mark. Your mother and I have a relationship that's all about a master/slave dynamic. When I said she was more like a pet to me, I meant it in the most literal way possible. Remember the time you found a dog collar under the couch, and I told you that we were getting a dog? That was a lie, son. Truthfully, your mom enjoys it when I put her on a leash and take her around the backyard. She's usually naked, of course. I can't explain why, but the whole thing is her idea. She'll piss on trees, sleep in dog cages, chew up furniture. One time she took a full-size, adult human shit in my Dockers. Your mom is a fucked-up slut, Mark, and I love her but I'm not taking that energy back to Viltrum with me. And frankly, she scares me sometimes . I don't know who molested her or how they did it, but there's some dark juju in that woman's head and I just don't know if I'm strong enough to fuck it all away.```
