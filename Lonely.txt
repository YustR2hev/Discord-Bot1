```I am so lonely. All the other Viltrumites are scared of me. No one talks to me. No one wants to be my friend, they think I am unstable. They send me from planet to planet committing atrocities in their name. And as I get better at it, they fear me more and more… I am a victim of my own success. Conquest… I don’t even get a real name, only a purpose. I am capable of so much more and no one sees it. Some days I feel so alone I could cry but I don’t, I never do, because what would be the point? Not a single person in the entire universe would care… Take it to your grave.```
