```Basically before the festival we play in game there were 2 previous ones. One waged among the villagers and one among the bremen army. Neither had any victors, as everyone got moonscorched, but Vile was a big participant in the first one. Unlike the other villagers who follow Rher's orders unwillingly, Vile seems to have embraced Rher's influence and might even have been or is currently a rher cultist, due to the fact that he's the only one who will even say his name, and is eagerly engaging in the festival. Additionally, Vile is one of the few moonscorched villagers who actually have a unique mutation, aside from the Woodsman. As we see from the film reel and the contestants of the 3d festival, when people are exposed to Moonscorching at a much faster rate, their mutations end up being significantly more in-depth than those who are exposed to moonscorching at a slower rate. We know that moonscorching can be caused prematurely by a mental breakdown of some sort, which could be the cause for Woodsman and Vile’s unique moonscorched forms. Woodsman could’ve had a breakdown during the first festival due to the guilt of killing people, or from the trauma of his wife’s betrayal, meanwhile Vile’s moonscorch must have been caused by something else. Since the Vile clearly enjoys the festival, it couldn’t have been from the trauma of killing people, but there is another explanation. Prehevil is considered an archaic town in the sense that the people there still worship all the old gods. This ties into my previous statement about Vile’s potential Rher worship, meaning that it’s possible that he had a breakdown halfway through the festival as a result of his Rher worship, which could have driven him insane.```
